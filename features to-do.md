# BUGS:

paste photo shows as blank

# SMALL TWEAKS

let me drag and drop photos in, then ask if i want to add it as a sticker (borderless png) or normal photo

change font of note to be the same as the journal modal

add an edit button on the customization toolbar on the left of delete that does the same thing as a long press to open up the editor

# MISSING FEATURES

background customization

2. No Physical Ephemera Import
   Real junk journals include receipts, tickets, handwritten notes, magazine clippings
   You only support photos from camera roll
   Fix: Add document scanner integration (expo-document-picker or camera-based scanning)

3. Limited Decoration Options
   No washi tape, stickers, stamps, or doodles yet
   The "tape" mentioned in specs isn't implemented
   Fix: Add SVG sticker library, draw-on-canvas capability, or stamp overlays

No Handwriting/Drawing
Real junk journals have hand-drawn doodles, arrows, circled dates
Fix: Add react-native-sketch-canvas or drawing mode

11. No Color/Mood Themes

Junk journals often have color-coordinated pages (all blue, all vintage, all pink)
Fix: Add page background options or color filter overlays

12. No Date/Timeline View

Hard to find "that page from summer 2024"
Fix: Add gallery/timeline view showing all pages chronologically

13. Limited Text Styling

Sticky notes are basic; no typewriter text, no stamps, no handwriting fonts yet
Fix: Load custom fonts (Patrick Hand, Caveat, Special Elite)

15. No Templates/Inspiration

Blank canvas is intimidating
Fix: Add starter templates (travel page, birthday, daily log)
